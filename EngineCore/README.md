# Engine Core 
(See [Concept](https://github.com/jbatnozic/Hobgoblin#concept))

## Directories
Here you will find:
- **Modules:** Various separate modules that make up the core of the engine.
- **Docs:** Unfortunately, nothing useful here for now. If you need information about a specific module, open
`Modules/<Module name>/README.md` and look there.
- **Test:** Unit tests for the core of the engine.
