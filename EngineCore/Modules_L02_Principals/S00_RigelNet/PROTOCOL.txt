For creating handlers:
The RN_ARGS types can be either pure types, or be single reference types to prevent copying in some places.

> Packet types [4B]:
	Hello     
	Connect   
	Disconnect
	Data,
	DataMore,
	DataTail
	Acks

> Hello:
	[Type][Passphrase]

> Connect:
	[Type][Passphrase][ClientID]

> Disconnect:
	[Type][Reason]

> Data, DataMore, DataTail:
	[Type][MessageOrdinal][Ack1][Ack2][...][0][DataMessage1][DataMessage2][...]

// As soon as a set of Data packet is received, we fire an untracked Ack packet, and this packet tells
// the remote host which packets were received and don't need to be held around in their memory anymore.
// We call these "weak" acknowledges. So called "strong" acknowledges are sent as part of a Data packet,
// and these are used to measure latency and information round trip time (because RigelNet nodes send
// and receive data at a consistent pace and not whenever it's available). Strong acknowledges are also
// a more sure confirmation that the connection is alive and functional.
