    // MARK: Event handling

    //! \brief Pop the event on top of the event queue, if any, and return it
    //!
    //! This function is not blocking: if there's no pending event then
    //! it will return false and leave \a event unmodified.
    //! Note that more than one event may be present in the event queue,
    //! thus you should always call this function in a loop
    //! to make sure that you process every pending event.

    //! \brief Wait for an event and return it
    //!
    //! This function is blocking: if there's no pending event then
    //! it will wait until an event is received.
    //! After this function returns (and no error occurred),
    //! the \a event object is always valid and filled properly.
    //! This function is typically used when you have a thread that
    //! is dedicated to events handling: you want to make this thread

    //! \brief Change the position of the window on screen

    // MARK: Focus

    //! \brief Request the current window to be made the active
    //!        foreground window
    //!
    //! At any given time, only one window may have the input focus
    //! to receive input events such as keystrokes or mouse events.
    //! If a window requests focus, it only hints to the operating
    //! system, that it would like to be focused. The operating system
    //! is free to deny the request.
    //! This is not to be confused with setActive().
    //!
    //! \see hasFocus

    //! \brief Check whether the window has the input focus
    //!
    //! At any given time, only one window may have the input focus

    //! area so it may no longer be moved outside its bounds.
    //! Note that grabbing is only active while the window has
    //! focus.

    //! it on screen.

    // MARK: Other

    //! \brief Enable or disable automatic key-repeat
    //!
    //! If key repeat is enabled, you will receive repeated
    //! KeyPressed events while keeping a key pressed. If it is disabled,
    //! you will only get a single event when the key is pressed.
    //!
    //! Key repeat is enabled by default.

    //! \param enabled True to enable, false to disable

    virtual void setVisible(bool aVisible) = 0;

    //! \brief Enable or disable vertical synchronization
    //!
    //! Activating vertical synchronization will limit the number
    //! of frames displayed to the refresh rate of the monitor.
    //! This can avoid some visual artifacts, and limit the framerate
    //! to a good value (but not constant across different computers).
    //!
    //! Vertical synchronization is disabled by default.
    //!
    //! \param enabled True to enable v-sync, false to deactivate it
    virtual void setVerticalSyncEnabled(bool aEnabled) = 0;

    //! \brief Limit the framerate to a maximum fixed frequency
    //!
    //! If a limit is set, the window will use a small delay after
    //! each call to display() to ensure that the current frame
    //! lasted long enough to match the framerate limit.
    //! SFML will try to match the given limit as much as it can,
    //! but since it internally uses sf::sleep, whose precision
    //! depends on the underlying OS, the results may be a little
    //! unprecise as well (for example, you can get 65 FPS when
    //! requesting 60).
    //!
    //! \param limit Framerate limit, in frames per seconds (use 0 to disable limit)
    virtual void setFramerateLimit(PZInteger aLimit) = 0;
