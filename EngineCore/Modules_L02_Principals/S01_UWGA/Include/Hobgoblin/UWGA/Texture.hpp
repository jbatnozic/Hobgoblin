    //! \brief Enable or disable repeating

    //! Repeating is involved when using texture coordinates

    //! will be repeated as many times as needed to reach the
    //! coordinate (for example, if the X texture coordinate is
    //! 3 * width, the texture will be repeated 3 times).
    //! If repeat mode is disabled, the "extra space" will instead
    //! be filled with border pixels.
    //! Warning: on very old graphics cards, white pixels may appear
    //! when the texture is repeated. With such cards, repeat mode
    //! can be used reliably only if the texture has power-of-two
    //! dimensions (such as 256x128).

    //! \brief Generate a mipmap using the current texture data
    //!
    //! Mipmaps are pre-computed chains of optimized textures. Each
    //! level of texture in a mipmap is generated by halving each of
    //! the previous level's dimensions. This is done until the final
    //! level has the size of 1x1. The textures generated in this process may
    //! make use of more advanced filters which might improve the visual quality
    //! of textures when they are applied to objects much smaller than they are.
    //! This is known as minification. Because fewer texels (texture elements)
    //! have to be sampled from when heavily minified, usage of mipmaps
    //! can also improve rendering performance in certain scenarios.
    //!
    //! Mipmap generation relies on the necessary OpenGL extension being
    //! available. If it is unavailable or generation fails due to another
    //! reason, this function will return false. Mipmap data is only valid from
    //! the time it is generated until the next time the base level image is

/// \class sf::Texture
/// \ingroup graphics
///
/// sf::Texture stores pixels that can be drawn, with a sprite
/// for example. A texture lives in the graphics card memory,
/// therefore it is very fast to draw a texture to a render target,
/// or copy a render target to a texture (the graphics card can
/// access both directly).
///
/// Being stored in the graphics card memory has some drawbacks.
/// A texture cannot be manipulated as freely as a sf::Image,
/// you need to prepare the pixels first and then upload them
/// to the texture in a single operation (see Texture::update).
///
/// sf::Texture makes it easy to convert from/to sf::Image, but
/// keep in mind that these calls require transfers between
/// the graphics card and the central memory, therefore they are
/// slow operations.
///
/// A texture can be loaded from an image, but also directly
/// from a file/memory/stream. The necessary shortcuts are defined
/// so that you don't need an image first for the most common cases.
/// However, if you want to perform some modifications on the pixels
/// before creating the final texture, you can load your file to a
/// sf::Image, do whatever you need with the pixels, and then call
/// Texture::loadFromImage.
///
/// Since they live in the graphics card memory, the pixels of a texture
/// cannot be accessed without a slow copy first. And they cannot be
/// accessed individually. Therefore, if you need to read the texture's
/// pixels (like for pixel-perfect collisions), it is recommended to
/// store the collision information separately, for example in an array
/// of booleans.
///
/// Like sf::Image, sf::Texture can handle a unique internal
/// representation of pixels, which is RGBA 32 bits. This means
/// that a pixel must be composed of 8 bits red, green, blue and
/// alpha channels -- just like a sf::Color.
///
/// Usage example:
/// \code
/// // This example shows the most common use of sf::Texture:
/// // drawing a sprite
///
/// // Load a texture from a file
/// sf::Texture texture;
/// if (!texture.loadFromFile("texture.png"))
///     return -1;
///
/// // Assign it to a sprite
/// sf::Sprite sprite;
/// sprite.setTexture(texture);
///
/// // Draw the textured sprite
/// window.draw(sprite);
/// \endcode
///
/// \code
/// // This example shows another common use of sf::Texture:
/// // streaming real-time data, like video frames
///
/// // Create an empty texture
/// sf::Texture texture;
/// if (!texture.create(640, 480))
///     return -1;
///
/// // Create a sprite that will display the texture
/// sf::Sprite sprite(texture);
///
/// while (...) // the main loop
/// {
///     ...
///
///     // update the texture
///     sf::Uint8* pixels = ...; // get a fresh chunk of pixels (the next frame of a movie, for example)
///     texture.update(pixels);
///
///     // draw it
///     window.draw(sprite);
///
///     ...
/// }
///
/// \endcode
///
/// Like sf::Shader that can be used as a raw OpenGL shader,
/// sf::Texture can also be used directly as a raw texture for
/// custom OpenGL geometry.
/// \code
/// sf::Texture::bind(&texture);
/// ... render OpenGL geometry ...
/// sf::Texture::bind(NULL);
/// \endcode
///
/// \see sf::Sprite, sf::Image, sf::RenderTexture
