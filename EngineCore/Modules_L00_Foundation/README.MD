# The Foundation

- **PDef:** Private preprocessor definitions for use by the engine implementation only.
- **Common:** Simple type definitions commonly used all across the engine.
- **Format:** It's literally just `libfmt`.
- **Preprocessor:** Preprocessor/macro utilities.
- **HGExcept:** Definitions of Hobgoblin's Traced Exceptions and of the related macros.
- **Logging:** Like it says on the can, it's a simple logging library.
- **Unicode:** Unicode support, using the `ICU4C` library, and some additional classes providing compatibility with
`Format`.
