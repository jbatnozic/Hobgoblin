**(TODO)**

A long time ago, in early 2020, when Hobgoblin was in its infancy and Overlays were still called Engine Extensions, the
pilot project to test the capabilities of the engine was called - very creatively - "Simple Platformer" (and it wasn't
so simple, being that it included complex networking and whatnot; but I digress). At that time, Simple Platformer
MultiPlayer Extensions (or SPeMPE for short, with the lowercase 'e' being there just for the aesthetics) was created
and would eventually evolve (a lot) into what you see here today.
