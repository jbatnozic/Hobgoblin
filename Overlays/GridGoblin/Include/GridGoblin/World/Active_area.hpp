//! This class is closely related to a GridGoblin World and its chunks.
//!
//! An active area represents an area of the world where 'stuff is happening' right now, or it's likely
//! to be so in the near future. In game terms, think of this as areas around the player character(s),
//! or around important NPCs which do something even when the player is not around.
//!
//! The role of an active area is twofold:
//! 1) chunks inside of an active area will be loaded by the world in the background by a worker thread;
//! 2) chunks inside of an active area will never be unloaded by the world.
//!
//! A note relevant to point 1): any interaction with a chunk or its cells, even just attempting to read
//! their values, will force the world to load the chunk, if it isn't loaded already, and block the
//! calling thread until it does so. Thus it is preferrable for one or more active areas to be large
//! enough and placed in such positions that all (or almost all) of the chunks required by the game will
//! essentially be loaded proactively, ahead of time.
class ActiveArea {
public:
    //! Destructor.
    ~ActiveArea();

    //! Sets the active area to contain no chunks.
    void setToNone();

    //! Sets the active area to an area defined by a central chunk and a square around it comprised of
    //! a number of rings. The 1st ring is the 8 chunks around the central chunk, the 2nd ring is the
    //! 16 chunks around the 1st ring, and so on (the ASCII art below serves as an illustration).
    //!

    //! \param aCentralChunk ID of the central chunks.
    //! \param aRingCount number of rings. If 0, only the central chunk will be included. If 1, the
    //!                   1st ring will be included. If 2, the 1st and 2nd rings will be included, and
    //!                   so on.
    //! \param aGetLoadPriority functor which will be 'asked' for the loading prioriy of each of the
    //!                         chunks in the area (except those that are outside of the world). If
    //!                         ommitted, the default scheme will be used (0 for the central chunks,
    //!                         N for chunks of Nth ring).
    //!
    //! \note chunks that are out of the bounds of the world will be handled properly and without
    //!       crashing, even if the central chunk is out of bounds.
